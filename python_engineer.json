I show you how to load the data using a tensorflow ImagaDataGenerator and implement a convolutional neural net to do image classification. I also introduce some new concepts like image augmentation and keras callbacks.\n\n\ud83e\ude81 Code faster with Kite, AI-powered autocomplete that integrates into VS Code (affiliate link):\nhttps://www.kite.com/get-kite/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=pythonengineer&utm_content=description-only\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 SUPPORT ME ON PATREON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nhttps://www.patreon.com/patrickloeber\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 JOIN MY NEWSLETTER \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nhttps://www.python-engineer.com/newsletter/\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to the channel!\n\nCourse material is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/python-engineer/tensorflow-course\n\nDownload the dataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/ihelon/lego-minifigures-classification\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/data_augmentation\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/\n\nYou can find me here:\nWebsite: https://www.python-engineer.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/python_engineer\nGitHub: https://github.com/python-engineer\n\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com/\n\n#Python"

AdaBoost is an ensemble technique that attempts to create a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers. We will first learn about the concept and the math behind this popular ML algorithm, and then we jump to the code.\n\n\ud83e\ude81 Code faster with Kite, AI-powered autocomplete that integrates into VS Code (affiliate link):\nhttps://www.kite.com/get-kite/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=pythonengineer&utm_content=description-only\n\n\ud83d\udcd3 Notebooks available on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/patrickloeber\n\n\u2b50  Join Our Discord : https://discord.gg/FHMg9tKFSN\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please subscribe to the channel!\n\nThe code can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/python-engineer/MLfromscratch\n\nFurther readings:\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-adaboost-2f94f22d5bfe\nhttps://machinelearningmastery.com/boosting-and-adaboost-for-machine-learning/\n\nYou can find me here:\nWebsite: https://www.python-engineer.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/python_engineer\nGitHub: https://github.com/python-engineer\n\n#Python #MachineLearning"

A lambda function is a small (one line) anonymous function that is defined without a name. It is typically used when you need a simple function that is used only once in your code, or it is used as an argument to higher-order functions. We will go over how you define them, and some use cases together with the built-in sorted(), map(), filter,() and reduce() functions.\n\n\ud83e\ude81 Code faster with Kite, AI-powered autocomplete that integrates into VS Code (affiliate link):\nhttps://www.kite.com/get-kite/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=pythonengineer&utm_content=description-only\n\n\ud83d\udcda Get my FREE NumPy Handbook:\nhttps://www.python-engineer.com/numpybook\n\n\ud83d\udcd3 Notebooks available on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/patrickloeber\n\n\u2b50  Join Our Discord : https://discord.gg/FHMg9tKFSN\n\nA written Tutorial can be found here:\nhttps://www.python-engineer.com/courses/advancedpython/08-lambda/\n\nYou can find me here:\nWebsite: https://www.python-engineer.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/python_engineer\nGitHub: https://github.com/python-engineer\n\n#Python"
